i bought this from motherhood and hated it ! ! ! it is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones , which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and do n't need more help ! ! the mother ez belt was fabulous though ! ! i wore it for the last 4 months ! ! ! forget about this one though ! ! !	0
this was inexpensive , attractive , excellent windbreaker . only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip .	1
my husband really likes the intimo men 's classic silk pants . they are very comfortable , and the color is really nice . he wears them almost every day ! the only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length	1
the belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price . very satisfied	1
i was pleased with all purchase . i did not feel that i was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer . in addition for reasons that are not clear to me , i continue to get duplicate orders , or the order is sent to an old address . the return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul	1
the other day i excitedly tried this bra on at walmart . i could n't believe i could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store . unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims . depending on the company i am a 38 dd or 34ff . i tried this bra on in a 38 dd . i was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support . basically under a shirt i sagged as if i was wearing no bra at all . that is not the effect i want when i go strapless . only goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety	0
suit was too small , not enough information available on the site for it . i called amazon , but even the customer representative was not sure the size . i bought the suit as he suggested , but it is too small	0
i purchased this bag to take on a tour of greece and was pretty happy with it . i loved the size , not to big and not too small , and also the flatness of it . it was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible . the only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body , the strap tends to rub at the neck , so i had to keep adjusting it every five minutes . overall it was pretty good , though	1
found the item to be poorly designed . did not fit my checks or recorder . item is useless unless you use checks with side tear	0
i tried these on and i 'll never wear boxers again ! they are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight . they are tight , but not too tight . i wear these to school as well ! i love them	1
this bra was a terrible waste of money . the wire on one side stabs me constantly . the other side is fine . it 's obviously defective .	0
first of all , they dont even go up to the thigh ! they attempt to sit right above the knee ! ! second , they do not stay up at all whatsoever ! ! ! i was sooooo embarrassed - i went out with them on and every ten seconds i was pulling them back up ... .. i am 5'3 '' and i weigh about 125 ... .i 'm average - these are a joke - price is too good to be true - do not bu	0
i hate this bra . the elastic band is not soft and rolls up as the day wears on . shoulder straps are skinny inadequate . only good thing is that it is low-cut . i prefer my $ 12 nursing bras purchased at wal-mart . i only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut	0
this was a very nice item . i bought it for my mom for christmas . she loved it . it was shipped very fast and i was informed very well on shipment information . this shoe was a great deal . usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal . thanks !	1
this shoe looked nice and stylish , but turned out to be very narrow ( even though i 've ordered it in size wide ! ! ! ) and uncomfortable . also had some glue marks on it -- i had to return it	0
this shoe is very comfortable , unfortunately i had to send it back to the manufacturer twice , the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are . i am very dissapointed as i have come to expect quality from merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks . i would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping	0
i ordered this dress and when i received it , i thought that it was very pretty . when i put the dress on , it was completely see through . you could see my bandaid on my thigh . i would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material . it 's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable . it would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress ( including pasties ) because it seemed to show everything	0
these bootie/slippers are terrible . they do n't ever stay on , there 's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made . i would give these 0 stars if i could , it was a complete waste of money- do n't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are	0
have always been pleased with this manufactures product . the company i purchased from was fair priced and very efficient	1
i love the style , fabric , fit , extremely comfortable ( but it is a t-shirt ) i 'm 5'2 and it does n't come past my hips	0
these work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable ! it does n't say so on the box , so when i first got them i thought they were way too small for adult heads and i was quite annoyed - however , you can adjust them once you put them on , just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly	1
although merchandise arrived quicker than promised , and the color was perfect , the socks did n't even last through one baseball game ... ... ... lousy product ! !	0
these socks are a bit on the thin side , but they withstand a lot of wear	1
got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced ! i 've literally never had a pair of boots that need this much breaking in and i own lots of boots . makes me not even want to to wear them	0
the actual bag itself was great . however , the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not . i ordered this bag and three weeks later it came . i had to go buy a bag to take on vacation . kind of defeated the purpose	0
not as expected , too short , nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks	0
look closely at the picture of the `` white '' top . it actually has red around the top and on the straps . to those of us who do n't want ugly red zig-zag thread ... ... .	0
i bought these shoes for my husband . i ordered them on a monday and they were at my house by wednesday ! i have owned a pair of `` real '' birks before and these look identical to them . my husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones	1
i want to help overseas products , but this advertises itself as cashmere . it itches my neck ! cashmere does not itch . color was not represented appropriately	0
i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items	1
these socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams . if this sort of design bothers you ( as it does me ) , then these are not the socks for you . these socks cause a lot of discomfort for me	0
it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly ... i want to get more ... thank	1
great product , works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description ... .thank	1
great little case we have two . i like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery .	1
these are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine , are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking . it 's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate .	1
we have always bought stride rite shoes for our son , however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months ! i was excited to find these here at such an awesome price . they are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them .	1
i purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top i 've worn to date . since then i have purchased 4 more	1
very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
these shoes are the best ! i like the removable wheel ! you could heel to school and when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on ! you will be heeling across the floor in no time if you keep practicing on them ! it took me a while to get the hang of these shoes ! you should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes ! they are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels !	1
this cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long . the texture went bobbly after one day near the arms	0
i am not a runner ; thus , i use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping , errands , hanging out , etc . i have owned many shoes over the years , and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes i have ever owned . i am hooked on the new balance line of running shoes .	1
i 'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received , but the case i received does n't cut it for the 60gb . it fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them . i do not recommend this product for the 60gb . i suppose we zen 60gb owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players	0
the lands end 60/40 oxford is the dress shirt to own ! it is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product ! i buy nothing but this shirt , and have multiple shirts in each color made . i 've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since i was 16 years old in prep school ( 35 years now ) , and the lands end is the best . i highly recommend this shirt	1
my husband , the star wars fanatic , loves them ! very comfy	1
i bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them . these are some great looking shoes .	1
did n't like the way these boots fit . the souls were really lumpy and you could feel it when you walked . they also looked really wierd on , they flattened out really wide and felt like your foot would slipp off of them sideways . returned them and paid for the shipping myself	0
i ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team 's competition , but i only received 12 in the mail . the packing slip said 16 and i was charged for the 16 . it was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores . would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time .	0
while the suit fits and looks great , my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit . it 's really the placement that bothered her . there is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam , which from a distance , looks like one had an accident in their trunks . thanks , but no thanks . these shorts are being returned	0
this is a nifty small appropiate change purse for men or anyone actuall	1
this boot looked so much better online . for this boot to be by nine west it looked very cheap . i was very disappointed with this product that i returned it but i 'm still waiting for my refund ! !	0
there was no picture of this selection , so i guessed it was a `` ringer '' type t-shirt . instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching . i never wore it , but gave it to goodwill	0
it will definitely get her attention in the best possible way	1
i purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather . they are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive . they will be returned .	0
this is the only shoe i wear for high impact jazzercise classes four+ times per week . i have a wide , flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly . and with boot cut jazz pants , they look great !	1
the phrase `` more efficient sourcing '' means that lands end is now buying these in china . the pants arrived with a strange smell ( fishy odor ) , the fit was odd , and , after one washing , the fabric looked bad . they went back asap ! i bought khakis from lands end for over a dozen years until this recent product change . notice the past tense . ownership by k-mart holdings is definitely making an impact on the company	0
this is just the perfect accessory for the cats costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital . got this in gray and brown too ! took a while for the product to get here . in fact , i had to re-order because of the delay -- but when finally the product arrived , it was worth the wait	1
these shoes were very cute , as i thought they would be from the pictures . but because of the sides being so short , they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking , especially when going up stairs . i returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..	0
it is a horrible item . if i could have given this hairagami a no star rating , i would have , and to think i wasted almost $ 20 for this junk . it snaps unexpectedly all the time , and always while you are twirling the hair . it totally tangles the hair . it is a nightmare to get out of your child 's hair . my oldest , 12 , really wanted this hairagami and was totally disappointed . she told all her friends not to buy it	0
get ee if you get these . the d is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable	0
these socks are just what i was looking for , a thin cotton blend to wear running . no bunching and they breath very well . the price and timliness of the order was also great	1
this item was just what i was looking for . i did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband 's ties or a tie bar . it is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving .	1
it clearly states for the shell material 100 % nylon . the price and the nylon shell was the main reason i bought the jacket . the jacket is completely polyester . the tag says shell : 100 % polyester and lining : 100 % polyester . returning it would be pointless . i 'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information	0
these crocs are very unique . they have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot . they are shaped like a birkenstock , but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed . the closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort . i wear them just about everyday to work . i chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because i work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea . the ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation . and , because crocs float in water , they make great shoes for boating or kayaking . they drain well and dry out quickly , plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it . i know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time . they are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes . i wear them when i am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside . in short , the crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes . treat your feet and buy them today	1
i 'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability . i just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in arizona to wear them more often :	1
when i saw in a magazine that croc was making a style of their shoes that was not ugly , i literally went the same day to dillard 's to get a pair for myself ! they are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you 're standing on clouds ! the amazon listing does n't show all the colors that they come in : light pink , silver , gold , celery , lavender , light blue , white , black and fuschia . all the colors are really adorable , and i had a hard time deciding ! i have also had issues with sizing , just as other reviewers have had . i usually wear a 7.5 wide in women 's shoes , but when i tried on the primas in an 8 , they were ridiculously big , and when i tried them on in a 7 , they were a tad too snug . i really wish they made half sizes . i ended up buying the 7 , even though it was a little small , but i read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet , that works like a charm : throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat , then pull them out , and while they are toasty warm , immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour , and voila , they will now fit perfectly ! grade : a-	1
i saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute , however , when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe . very very disappointed , i will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again .	0
item send was not new . obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use . also a rip in the design	0
we loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo . old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them . they are so easy to get on him , and we all know some are so difficult . these slide right on while pulling the tongue . they are also wide enough for his `` flinstone '' feet , lol . they break in well for flexibility too .	1
i just purchased fleece hoodies and pants by andrew christian , the material is wonderful . the hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin . i would recommend them highly . the pansts are low-rise , since i am older , i am still getting used to that , but they too feel really good on .	1
i usually wear size 7m . however , this shoe of size 7m is way too small . i have to return it to amazon and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself . i will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear	0
i love these shoes ! the service was great , the price great ! these are really good shoes . i have a hard time finding wide shoes where i live . these were perfect ! very comfortable , very good quality . this is where i will be buying my shoes	1
i liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived . they fit my husband 's feet well and he likes them . the only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace .	1
i found it very comfortable with good fitting . i bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best . i gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that i bought . overall quality is good .	1
i took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately i gave them away after trying them on . the fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible	0
shirt really made a `` hit '' . arrived shortly after placing order	1
hey ! i 'm twelve years old and i just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these . they feel really nice on the skin and they do n't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do . they also give really good support to your penis . they keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort . boys , ya 'll all seriously need to try these undies out . they 're awesome	0
this merchant really delivers with this item - in the stores , this is almost twice the price . i really was n't expecting such quality from this item ( yes , it 's crushed velvet , so not warm , but warm was n't the goal ) . would definitely recommend this item , and may buy another color for myself	1
i originally wanted the orange colored tsubos , but they were out of stock , so i decided to go with the pickle color . i absolutely love em ! the comfort and style are unique and satisfying . it is because of shoes like this i have become a shoe expert of sorts	1
nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? it looks good but is it 4 '' x 8 '' or 12 '' x 8 '' ? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy ... ... ... ... . da trol	0
i really liked the black tuxedo outfit , my son wore it in a pageant and won , so i am very very happy about that . the tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him	1
i too have been searching for the panty in the picture . i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg . there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric , but there is more like 3 inches ... yuk ! ; b has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured ? ( the ones that we all seem to love and want ) ? please email me personally if u have found them ! sheemna @ yahoo.co	0
i have to tell anyone , who has lower back or foot pain , to try a pair of merrells . when you try them on , they feel comfortable , but once you wear them for a week , you 'll never wear another brand of footwear ( unless you have to ) . most of their shoes need no `` break in '' time . i own these in four different colors . my eldest daughter owns two pairs of these . i own more than 20 pairs of merrells , i have been wearing these for years . the cool thing about them is , when you see someone else wearing a pair , it 's like you 're both in on a secret . you know , you 're walking in heaven	1
i ordered the black one . according to the photo provided , it was supposed to be black with white seams , but when i received it , it was all black . once i put it on it fitted perfectly . but it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size .	0
very disappointing ! i ordered stretch jeans . i paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not stretch jeans . i called cust . service . he spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he ( bealls cust.serv . ) sent me another pair i would get the same thing . in order to get money back i had to return the item . now i 've paid postage again ! and yes i did receive the $ 12.99 credit for the jeans , but what about the postage ? this was not my fault ! the item was incorrect ! ! your return policy indicates that yo uwill pay the postage , so if you need to see a copy ( which i also put in the return box ) of what i ordered , please feel free to contact me . i printed it out so i can fax it , scan it email it , or snail mail it , or however you would like to receive it . please return the shipping costs that i paid for a product that apparently mismarked . thanks , debbie pearson p.s . i see the title description has been corrected to show that these are not stretch jeans -- wish i would have known so that i would not have to be writing this review . if no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon , but especially not bealls	0
when i got ordered these shoes , i was so excited because the picture looked so nice . do not be deceived by its looks . i saw it in another store , and i tried it on for fun . the shoe fits poorly , and its actually really ugly . i would definitely not reccomend it to any one	0
i find this store to be very accomodating . will definitely shop there again	1
the fatigues were just what my son wanted . the only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order . i guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom . but my son did n't want that so i had to hem about four inches on each leg . other than that it was an excellent product	1
my mother loves these pants . i know they are for men , but she loves the way they fit her . they are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better .	1
i did not like this product at all . it is very hard to use and too small	0
this is cute , funny , and it 's not uncomforable ! i think it rocks ! i love this movie ... i even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	1
my son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class	1
these are , by far , the most comfortable boots i have ever owned ! i am a huge fan of dansko clogs , and these frye boots are just as comfortable and sturdy ! they run a bit on the large side , about a half size difference . you will love them ! ! ! !	1
on the advertisement , these sandals were shown in green . if they were available in green , i would be interested . please advise . thank	0
these boots look very nice , but unfortunately , it is way too narrow ( and i have narrow feet ) . my whole foot felt squashed . back to amazon it goes	0
i love it . it is just what i wanted . great deal and smooth transaction . thanks	1
i have been searching for the perfect ped sock , not too thick , not so thin it slides off your heel and , most importantly , cotton . my search is over . this is by far the best sock ever . great with sneakers and closed in shoes .	1
this is the best of the small front pocket wallets available . other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that do n't work well . this is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet , only reduced to 4x3 inches . holds three cards , bills , and id as well as having a little room under the id card for business cards . great buy	1
i recieved this item yesterday . initaly i was very happy , it changed my 8gb black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it . the inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through , i would have preferred an opaque white , but it did not look terribly bad with the green , though blue , red , or any other color than green would have been better with the black i had not the inital foresight to picture this . i was still pretty happy at this point . the hip-clip was removed right away , i have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my logitech mm50 ( portable speaker ) without taking it out of the case , eureka , this case did that , without the clip of course . the lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today i discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the ipod nano , so that i would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost . well , i was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off . unitl , i discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case . now , despite the fact that this is the `` aluminum '' iskin duo , this was not the case at all . the green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look . okay that was still acceptable , until , i discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off , sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away . that was it , that was the broke back camel inducement , and now i am the proud owner of a case that i will never be happy with . at first i had been all excited , and was considering the purchase of other colors , not now , this in my consideration was a waste of money . hopefully i 'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done . sincerly ro	0
i just got my pair of sandals.i regret i didnot read the customer review before buying . although very cute and trendy sandles , but are very uncomfortable	0
these shoes are very comfortable , look great but i had a terrible problem with the `` ruggedness '' of these shoes . i am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that merrill is known for , ruggedness and great outdoor shoes . after only owning these shoes for a month i noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole . this happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair . the insides ripped from slipping them on and off . i returned the pair to the store i bought them at and got a new pair . the same problem happened . these shoes are very cheap and very expensive . do not buy ! they look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only i would stay away from them	0
i love the garrick sandal . it was exactly what i expected as seen in the stores . delivery , and service was excellent	1
these shoes are so comfortable and cute ! i 've gotten a lot of compliments on them , and i like their old-school pony look	1
ordered these bra extenders since i an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things , and they are working great ! recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as i expected ! thanks !	1
tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable . the stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix . good deal	1
i think that these shoes are very sassy , but i ran into one problem ordering them online ... they are n't true to their size . i always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on , my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes . order wisely	0
i was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived . they appear used and have a small stain on them . as a result i will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again . lesson learned	0
this is a beautiful shoe by rockport , but beware , it runs really narrow . i even went a size up from my usual to compensate . i ended-up sending them back anyway . so if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal	1
and i am very pleased with them . they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	1
the item is not my concern ; i still have not even received it	0
these are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs i 've found that are actually designed with a `` pouch '' , making them the most comfortable on the market ( of all the brands i 've tried , that is ) . unfortunately , they 're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets , and you 'll probably have to purchase them from an amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges , but what can i say . i guess it 's worth it . the briefs also run about a size small . i have a 31 '' waist but the mediums are too small .	1
we bought this for our teenage son . the handling of the shipping was prompt , that is the only good thing i can say about the coat . i will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality , almost felt-like . the item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box , looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school ! i am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat . if it was not so cold , i would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing ! the item pills making it look really shabby . no reports of seams ripped , buttons lost , or holes in the pocket , however , he may be worried that if he tells me about those things i will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money . it was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself , so imagine his disappointment ! i expected much more of the coat than i got , and i am looking for a replacement	0
i bought this dress for a trip i 'm taking in one week . should 've known better . you get what you pay for , that 's for sure . this dress arrived balled up in a usps bag . it did n't look anything like the picture shown on this site , more like a slip , than a slip dress . and here 's the kicker - it was ripped ! had two large `` snags '' on the back of the dress . i 'm sending it back and they better not try to charge me shipping . i 'm po 'd to the max and who knows if i 'll find a dress in time . grrrr	0
i am happy with this bag ( i got the pink and white one ) . it is a lovely color , nice size , durable and good price . it comes with an outside pocket and i received it quickly . my only complaint is that almost $ 7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $ 3.99 , otherwise i highly recommend this bag .	1
the ipod mini case self is very good from pacific design . but amazon made a mistake to choose ebags as their supplier . i have ordered one ipod and one ipod mini cases for my friend 's daughters as a christmas gift . the ipod case was shipped from amazon directly , as usual , it was nice packed and fast shipping . the other ipod mini was shipped from ebags . it was bad , bad and bad . i wo n't order anything from ebags any more . here is why : - it was almost one week later than amazon 's shipment . - it was an open , unpacked or returned item . - amazon charges the shipping for that item , even you qualify for the free shipping on your order . if you do n't care about all of these , please go ahead and good luck . i gave 2 stars is because of the product self , otherwise i would give none	0
very good quality , nice leather , sturdy , and can be used for anything . big enough as a book bag , great carry on , a purse ... etc . i am very satisfied with my purchase ... .the bag is made in the states , and a great price , for a quality made item . i highly recommend this leather bag	1
the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it . fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box . i tried it on just to see if i 'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition , and it was not cute on . i immediately returned it	0
in my case , the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough . my feet are size 14 and eee width ( but some ee made on wide lasts can fit ) . the boots that i received were marked 14 ee but would n't even allow my feet half way in . i wish they fit because they look good , the quality is good , and price unbeatable . however , i lost $ 8.50 at the ups when i sent them back	0
this is a great item to have if you are loosing weight . you can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones	1
these are the first mootsies tootsies i have owned and i love em.since then i have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots . these shoes are very comfortable	1
the shawl is very thin , not good quality , i suspect it is not cashmere at all , but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools . the color was supposed to be expresso , not even that promise was fulfilled , it is a much lighter brown . i do not recommend this shawl at all	0
as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present `` one size fits all , '' it becomes increasingly difficult for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in anything other than the most expensive brands . these shoes are well made and an excellent value . the only negative is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer to make them narrow . the heel tends to wallow a little bit in my particular case	1
it took a week and two days for my pants to arrive , i bought another item from amazon the same day and it arrived in three days . my experience with this company 's shipping was n't good	0
looks very nice , material is not bad..just a little big from my original siz	1
well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got . and i was not to be disappointed . they are really awesome ! ! they are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play . i even wear them to office sometimes ; ) though after wearing them for a long stretch of time , i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star . but they are worth every single penny i spent on them . if you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too , look no furthe	1
i love naughty monkey ! i 'm so happy with their shoes ! they do n't hurt my feet	1
this case is really nice and compact . there is a nice place for a card or x-tra batteries inside . is snuggly fits the hp digital camera . protects well . and well padded . very nice case	1
these are the best ever ! i bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because i had seen similar 'crocs ' at local stores for far less . well , these are worth every cent ! my daughter and i went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand ... no comparison ! these are the best	1
these shoes are cute but 1 ) they are made wide 2 ) the heel is a little bigger than 2 '' 3 ) they are uncomfortable to walk in . i think i could find a better pair at wal-mart if i had to . the company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a big two thumbs down for that	0
my husband liked his slippers i got him for christmas . he said that they were warm and soft	1
i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered , i like it . delivery is fast . i will order something else	1
these pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . i look forward to your reply	0
just got them in the mail today . as other kenneth cole reaction shoes , it runs one size larger . i 'm usually a 12 but i ordered an 11 and they fit just right . these boots look great with jeans . the color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph .	1
bag was well made , but too small . ca n't put much in it . nice well-made leather bag . if it was three times bigger it would be a perfect .	0
we had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair . the idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing . my daughter was excited when she opened the box and she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice . the problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair . the directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair . well , we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs . none of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads . she has very long hair with a lot of wave so i guess if you had short , straight hair , this product would be fine for you	0
love , love , love gerber products and these are no exception . great quality and they are so soft . the only thing is that the 0-3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3-6	1
i wish i did not order this one . the picture looks nice but when i got it today , i really got disappointed . when you look at it closer , the wood beads , sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking . i wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads .	0
i was very dissappointed by this item . it arrived folded into a 6x6 square bag and was very creased when opened . it will take considerable pressing to try and get it out . the fabric is too stiff and does n't drap well . the length is n't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap . the return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk	0
i found these at lane bryant and i absolutely love them ! i wear them under my work clothes every day . you 've got to try them	1
the shirt came fast.it 's a good quality shirt.i 'm satisfied with it	1
columbia sport sandals for kids are great ! we 've bought them three years in a row now for our kids . they hold up well , are comfy , and the colors are great . easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze . they 're well constructed , but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while . they wo n't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size	1
these are made of a nice material and good for travelling . however , the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing . as soon as i sit , nothing is really being covered . with a longer inseam , these would be awesome	0
the actual bag itself was great . however , the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not . i ordered this bag and three weeks later it came . i had to go buy a bag to take on vacation . kind of defeated the purpose	0
i have been a fan of asics shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate , which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches . asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which i love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints , until i found these shoes . i absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again . this is the only type of shoe i will ever buy and has been the only one i have bought for 7 years now ! i highly recommend this shoe ! especially if your feet tend to overpronate	1
you have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit properly . they only fit properly for one wearing , stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry . i have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought i would try these . `` you get what you pay for '' applies to this product	0
i brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party , because i knew the girls would like them . i 've been wearing them for over a year and i like them a lot . my husband does too . they look good , turn him on , turn me on too . you ca n't ask for more than that in a panty , now can you	1
these were a gift at christmas , and were a deep burgundy color . they do appear to be well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading , and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore . the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	0
it is ironic that you would send this to me . i can not tell you how excited i was to purchase these slippers . i had bought everyone in my family ugg slippers for christmas . everyone had cozy slippers but me ... ..so instead of paying over $ 60 i found this pair of warmbat on amazon . i researched the brand and thought they may be a good match . i received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner . the next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off . i was upset and sewed them , and glued them . the following week the left slipper fell apart . i did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers , they were $ 29.00 . sooooooooooooooo disappointed . please forward to warmbat	0
i have had plenty of pairs of doc 's but these are not the best for me ... ... ... .. they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in . as soon as i put them on and took one step -- -- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease ... ... ... it does not look nice and i am `` ticked '' about that ... ... ... ..plus i didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces ... ... it looks dorky ! plus i have a manufacturing flaw in them . inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck ! hopefully the next model i get isnt like thses or they are going back ... ... . putting up with these for now ... ... .	0
my son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play	0
i purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color . they were so comfortable that i purchased two more pair in different colors ! the straps are very comfortable - they 're elastic and not tight or constraining . the shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes . i can wear these shoes for both the am and pm services to church , where i usually have to wear a different pair for the pm service because my feet hurt so bad ! it 's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels , so when you can find them , stock up on them	1
one of the most comfortable bras i 've ever worn . i own several , and they 're just about all i 'll wear ! very nice fit , and good look under clothes	1
i wore these shoes when i worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet , ankles , knees and hips . i could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the `` teeth '' in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good . being diabetic , i am very concerned about circulation and i believe this was a good purchase . a little expensive , but well worth it in the end . i plan on buying more	1
i was so happy when i found these shoes , they are cute and comfortable , exactly what i was looking for . but after about two weeks of wearing them , always with socks or pantyhose , they started to smell terrible . i do n't have this problem with any of my other shoes . this was so disappointing , i will either try to return them or just trash them .	0
i can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said . i have 1 of the 41 '' for summer and now 2 of the 50 '' for fall and winter . the colors remain solid after mutiple washes , and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts . also very comfortable . highly recommend ! ngmackie , dunwoody , ga	1

i bought these because i normally ca n't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert . these are great . very comfortable . i plan on living in them this summer . i bought a size 8 croc which was fine . these were on the big size so i exchanged them for the next smaller size . i guess i am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes , go smaller with the athens croc	1
absolute gems . simple , versatile shoes that are fun , comfortable , and have great casual style . i have them in red , wear them to work , when traveling , and the one time i got stuck in a surprise seattle snowstorm , they even had traction . nearly an all-purpose shoe .	1
good quality , well built vest of full bodied fleece . vest is slightly fitted at the waist for a feminine look and the arm holes are neatly close fitting to keep the warmth in . sizes run alittle large . i love my extra small vest and my daughter loves her small vest	1
these boots are gorgeous ! i got such an awesome deal on these boots ; i searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them ! i 'll put one up here . they 're comfy , rich leather , well made . i 've always wanted frye boots	1
these are wonderful sandals . tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail . finally did the right thing and went online . great sandals at a very reasonable price . you wo n't be sorry if you purchase these . very stylish and very comfortable	1
